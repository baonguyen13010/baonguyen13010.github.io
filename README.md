1. Sales by Category(Bar Chart) - Shows which products sold the  most

2. Prime vs Non-Prime Customers(Pie Chart) - Shows who spends more

3. Discount Effectiveness(Line Chart) - Shows which discounts work best

4. Customer Age Groups(Radar Chart) - Shows who's buying

5. Customer Ratings(Stacked Bar) - Shows what products people like

It was made with the help of fake ai AI-generated data, chart.js library as well as bootstrap.
